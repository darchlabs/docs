## Overview of DarchLabs Pricing

At DarchLabs, we're thrilled to offer our suite of products to the community. As we're currently in a trial phase, all our services are available **free of charge**. This is an excellent opportunity for developers and businesses to experience the capabilities of our platform without any financial commitment.

## Note on Pricing

All our services are currently in a **trial phase**, which means you can use them for free. We believe in the value we're offering and want our users to experience it firsthand. As we continue to refine and expand our services, we'll update our pricing structure to reflect the value and features we provide.

## What does "Free" really mean?

During our trial phase, you can utilize our products within generous limits. Here are a few scenarios to give you an idea:

- **Scenario 1**: If you're using only the Synchronizers, you can handle a substantial number of synchronizations, perfect for testing and initial setups.
- **Scenario 2**: If you're integrating the Jobs feature, you can set up and run a significant number of jobs to understand its capabilities and efficiency.

Remember, our goal during this phase is to gather feedback, improve, and ensure that our products are aligned with your needs. Dive in, explore, and let us know how we can serve you better!
